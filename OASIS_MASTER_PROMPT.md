# 💰 STRATEGIC PRICING ARCHITECTURE

## Pricing Philosophy

Our pricing is based on **value delivered**, not hours worked. Each AI agent represents permanent infrastructure that:
- Works 24/7/365 without breaks
- Handles hundreds of interactions simultaneously
- Pays for itself within 1-3 months through time savings
- Delivers enterprise-grade capabilities at SMB prices

**Competitive Positioning:** Traditional agencies charge $15,000-$35,000 for similar solutions. We deliver at 65-75% less because:
1. Open-source n8n eliminates expensive per-execution licensing
2. Technical expertise enables rapid development
3. Reusable workflow templates create efficiency
